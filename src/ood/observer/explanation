webhook : add extra plugins features without touching the custom activity's code
A webhook is an http callback, an http post that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via
http post

a webhook application implementing webhooks will post a message to a url when certain things happen(it's a observer pattern)

github has built-in support: webhooks allow you to build or set up github apps which subscribe to certain events on github
when one of them is triggered, a http post payload to webhook's configured url

for example
we may save our configuration file of a website on our git repo, when we change the configuration file, github will
send a post request containing the change to the server, then the server will read properties from the repo
