for example, if our object have many properties
material: iron, copper, bronze, glass
shape: round, square, triangle
thickness: thick, thin
...

we can create our class like

ThickBox {
    Box box;
    int edge;
}

ColorBox {
    Box box;
    Color color;
}

if we want a thick box with a specific color
ColorBox cb = new ColorBox(box, c);
ThickBox tb = new ThickBox(cb, e);
