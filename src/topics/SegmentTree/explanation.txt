Discrete version of a segment tree:
a balanced binary tree. O(logN) height given n elements

Each leaf node(segment) represents an element in the array
Each non leaf node covers the union of its children's range

Operations:
  build(start, end, vals) -> O(n)
  update(index, value) -> O(logn)
  rangeQuery(start, end) -> O(logn + k)
  where k is the number of reported segments
