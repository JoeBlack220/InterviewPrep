networks
1.most IP networks are designed for at least a 3:1 download-speed: upload-speed ratio
2.Read can be asynchronous, or take advantage of other performance optimizations like gzip compression or chunked transfer
encoding, the web server can switch serve reads faster and switch between clients quickly serving many more requests
per second than the max number of connections. Writes, on the other hand, tend to maintain an open connection for the duration for the
upload, so uploading a 1MB file could take more than 1 second on most home networks, so that web server could only handle 500
such simultaneous writes. A web server like Apache or lighttpd typically has an upper limit on the number of simultaneous
connections it can maintain and in high traffic, writes can quickly consume all of those.
database
1.writes are generally slower than reads, even if everything is in memory or read from disks (like SSDs)
