using a facade as a consistent interface for client to use more easily

like the assembly code in compilation process

advantages
1.it shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components
2.it promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients

usage
when you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system
when several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction
