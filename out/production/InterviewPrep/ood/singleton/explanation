In a multithreaded environment, create a thread safe singleton class that creates an instance of a class if one has not yet
been created, if one has been created then it should simply return an instance of the already created class

1.singleton : only 1 instance
2.lazy instantiation: instantiate when needed (call get method)
3.thread safe: atomicity, consistency, visibility

advantages of a singleton class
ensures only one instance of class is created
provides a global single point of access
one of the simplest design pattern to implement
better alternative- use singletons in an IoC container such as spring
